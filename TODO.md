* When discussing unnormalized databases, show the actual normalized database with the orders, not just the schema
* Explain how it fixes the insertion, deletion, and update anomalies

* With the Employee-Jobs-Department example, do a brief introduction of keys to implement relations, and of the bridge table.

* Show the tables with the actual contents to illustrate how the relationships are implemented

* Perhaps move the "Functions" and "CASE" part earlier (in SELECT). Example: Examine the Birthday of a student (use YEAR(Birthday) as a function example) and then use CASE to flag problematic years CASE YEAR(Birthday) < 1980 AND Status='Undergrad' THEN 'Invalid'). Example for CASE, convert Political Views to Conservative / Liberal / Other)

* Move UNION earlier as well?
